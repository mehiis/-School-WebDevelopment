    <h1>Assignment 5</h1>
    <p>
      Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and
      calculates the sum of all the natural numbers up to and including that
      integer using a for loop.<br />
      The program should display the sum on the HTML document. Natural numbers
      are positive integers used for counting and representing quantities.<br /><br />

      Let's consider the example of the number 5. When the user enters 5, the
      program will calculate the sum of all the natural numbers up to and
      including 5. <br />
      In this case, the natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The program will
      use a <b>for</b> loop to iterate through each of these numbers and add
      them together. <br />
      Finally, the program will display the sum, which in this case would be 15,
      on the HTML document.
