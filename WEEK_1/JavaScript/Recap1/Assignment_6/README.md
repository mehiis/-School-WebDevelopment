Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and generates a multiplication table up to that number using a for loop. The multiplication table displays the product of each pair of numbers from 1 to the entered number.


     - Your program should follow these steps:
         - Write JavaScript code that prompts the user to enter a positive integer using the prompt() function. Store the user's input in a variable.
         - Convert the user's input from a string to a number.
         - Use nested for loops to generate the multiplication table.
         - The outer loop will iterate from 1 up to the entered number, representing the rows of the table.
         - The inner loop will also iterate from 1 up to the entered number, representing the columns of the table.
         - Inside the nested loops, calculate the product of the current row and column values.
         - Display each product in a formatted way to create the multiplication table on the HTML document.


Example Output:
´´´
Enter a positive integer: 5

Multiplication Table:
1   2   3   4   5
2   4   6   8   10
3   6   9   12  15
4   8   12  16  20
5   10  15  20  25
´´´
´´´
Enter a positive integer: 3

Multiplication Table:
1   2   3
2   4   6
