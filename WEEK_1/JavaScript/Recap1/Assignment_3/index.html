      Write a program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides
      of a triangle and determines the type of triangle based on the side
      lengths.<br />
      The program should classify the triangle as equilateral (all sides are
      equal), isosceles (two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).
      <br />
      Print the result on the HTML document.
