Write a program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines the type of triangle based on the side lengths.
The program should classify the triangle as equilateral (all sides are equal), isosceles (two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).

Print the result on the HTML document.
