    <h1>Assignment 6</h1>
    <p>
      Write a program that allows users to track and rate their favorite movies.
      The program should prompt the user to enter the details of each movie,
      including the title and rating on a scale of 1 to 5. The program should
      store the user input in an array of objects using object literals. Once
      all the movie ratings have been entered, the program should sort the
      movies based on their ratings and determine the highest-rated movie.
      Finally, it should display the sorted list of movies and the highest-rated
      movie on the HTML document.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Use object literals to represent each movie, with properties such as
        title and rating.
      </li>
      <li>Prompt the user to enter the number of movies they want to rate.</li>
      <li>
        Use a loop to gather user input for each movie, including the title and
        rating. Store the movie details in an array of objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sort the array of movie objects based on the ratings, from highest to
        lowest.
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine the highest-rated movie by accessing the first element of the
        sorted array.
      </li>
      <li>
        Display the sorted list of movies and the highest-rated movie on the
        HTML document.
      </li>
    </ol>
