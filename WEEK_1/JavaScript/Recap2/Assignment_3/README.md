Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers one by one and extracts and displays only the even numbers from the entered values using the for...of loop.

    - Define an empty array to store the numbers entered by the user.
    - Use a loop (e.g., while or do...while) to prompt the user for numbers and add them to the array until the user decides to stop.
    - Use the for...of loop to iterate over the entered values stored in the array.
    - Inside the loop, check if the current number is even using the modulo operator %.
    - If the current number is even, display it on the HTML document.
    - After the loop completes, display a message indicating the end of the program.


    - Prompts:

        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 5
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 12
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 8
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 3
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 10
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): done


    - Example Output:

        Even Numbers: 12, 8, 10


    - Prompts:

        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 1
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 3
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 5
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): 7
        Enter a number (or 'done' to finish): done


    - Example Output:

        Even Numbers: None
