Write a JavaScript program that focuses on various array operations using the push(), includes(), pop(), and numerical sorting functions. Your program should include the following requirements:

    - Create an empty array called numbers.
    - Prompt the user to enter five numbers, one by one, and add each entered number to the numbers array using the push() method.
    - Display the contents of the numbers array on the HTML document or in the console.
    - Prompt the user to enter a number and check if the entered number is included in the numbers array using the includes() method.
    - Display a message indicating whether the entered number is found or not found in the numbers array.
    - Remove the last number from the numbers array using the pop() method.
    - Display the updated numbers array on the HTML document or in the console.
    - Sort the numbers array in ascending numerical order using the sort() method with a custom comparison function.
    - Display the sorted numbers array on the HTML document or in the console.


Example Output:

Enter Number 1: 10
Enter Number 2: 5
Enter Number 3: 7
Enter Number 4: 3
Enter Number 5: 9

Numbers: [10, 5, 7, 3, 9]

Enter a Number to Search: 7
Number 7 is found in the array.

Updated Numbers: [10, 5, 7, 3]

Sorted Numbers: [3, 5, 7, 10]
