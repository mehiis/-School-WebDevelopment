Write a JavaScript program that focuses on the basic concepts of arrays. Your program should include the following requirements:

    - Create an array called fruits and initialize it with the following elements: "apple", "banana", "orange", " grape", "kiwi".
    - Display the contents of the fruits array in the console.
    - Calculate and display the length of the fruits array.
    - Access and display the element at index 2 in the fruits array in the console.
    - Access and display the last element in the fruits array using the length property in the console.
    - Create an empty array called vegetables.
    - Prompt the user to enter three vegetables one by one, and add each entered vegetable to the vegetables array using the push() method.
    - Display the contents of the vegetables array in the console.
    - Calculate and display the length of the vegetables array.


Example Output:

Fruits: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"]
Length of Fruits: 5
Element at Index 2: "orange"
Last Element of Fruits: "kiwi"
Vegetables: ["carrot", "broccoli", "cabbage"]
Length of Vegetables: 3
